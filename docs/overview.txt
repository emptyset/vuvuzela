overview

[deployment]
- as the vuvuzela user, clone the repository, switch to the current branch, and git pull
- as root, run the deploy script in /home/vuvuzela
- this copies vuvuzela.conf, an upstart configuration file, to /etc/init
- it also copies vuvuzela.py to /usr/bin/local/vuvuzela
- finally, /var/run/vuvuzela is created (with chown vuvuzela:vuvuzela permissions)
- also, root runs $ initctl reload-configuration

[start up process]
- as root, run $ start vuvuzela
- log messages should appear in /var/log/syslog
- if there is an error with the upstart script or some component, it should appear in /dev/.initramfs/vuvuzela.log
- vuvuzela.py double-forks, which is a typical pattern for *nix daemons to follow, and the upstart configuration file expects this
